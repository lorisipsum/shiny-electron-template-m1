# Forking this from Jinhwan combined with some of Abby's code made this possible

> [!NOTE] 
> I had to make some changes to Jinwhan's code because his was setup for a M1 chip, which I do not have.
> Futhermore, there were many annoying errors that popped up when trying to start the app with Jinwhan's original code.
> I also had to make some changes to Abby's original code because auto-unpack-natives and fuseat were
> both trying to take control of the start command.
> Melding both of their work together enabled me to properly make this first Electron app :)
> Saving this here for future reference!

## Getting started

### A. Environment setup

> [!NOTE]
> All of the following steps can be run exclusively in the RStudio **Terminal** (right to **console**).
>
> so **Terminal** means Rstudio's terminal using <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>m</kbd>

1. Install **R**, **Rstudio**.
2. Install **Node.js**: from <a href = "https://nodejs.org/en/" target = "_blank"> offical page </a>
3. Install **Electron Forge** using `npm` (`npm` is installed with `Node.js`)
4. In the **Terminal**, run `sudo npm i -g @electron-forge/cli`, (`sudo` requires password)

> [!NOTE]
> Check your versions of `node` and `npm` in **Terminal** with `node -v`, `npm -v`.

5. Give **Star** ‚≠ê, **Fork** this repository to your own account. Then **clone** it to your local PC

### B. Elecron project

6.  Open an R project with cloned repository's `.Rproj` file.
7.  In your project directory (may `Github/shiny-electron-template-m1`), install **Electron** locally by running `npx create-electron-app <APPNAME>`.

> [!WARNING]
> You can not use `app` as `<APPNAME>` <br>
> Assume using `myapp` in this tutorial

8.  In your `myapp` folder, **delete** `src` directory
9.  Copy (or move) below files to your `myapp` folder:

-   `get-r-mac.sh`: For install local R for electron app.
-   `add-cran-binary-pkgs.R`: For install R packages into your project locally
-   `start-shiny.R`: Let electron call your shiny app

-   Folder **shiny** from this template, containing:
    -  `shiny/app.R`: **THIS IS YOUR SHINY APP'S CODE**    

-   Folder **src** from this template, containing:         
    -   src/helpers.js     
    -   src/index.css     
    -   src/index.js     
    -   src/loading.css     
    -   src/loading.html     
    - `src/main.js`: configure shiny electron app (like `width`, `height`)

10. Change your directory to new app folder `cd myapp` with **Terminal**

### C. Setup R 

11. Install local R with `sh ./get-r-mac.sh`
    -   First, check the version of R on your machine. In the R **Console**, run `version`.

> [!WARNING]
> **Your PC's R version** and **electron's R version** must same

12. Build `app.R` as your application's code.

> [!NOTE]
> not only `app.R` also other required files for shiny application (like `/www`)

13. If you don't have the `automagic` package installed, run `install.packages("automagic")` in the **console**.

14. In the Rstudio **terminal**, run `Rscript add-cran-binary-pkgs.R` to get packages for R.

> [!NOTE]
> If your shiny application uses not-CRAN packages (like `github` / `bioconductor`), See **Add not-CRAN packages** below.
> 

### D. Setup electron

15. Change `package.json` as <a target = "_blank" href='%5Bfix%5D%20package-json'>`[fix] packages-json`</a>'s content. And modify **author** information.

> [!NOTE]
> Node package's version confirmed in 2024.01

16. Change `forge.config.js` as <a target = "_blank" href = '/%5Bfix%5D%20forge.config.js'>`[fix] forge.config.js`</a>'s content. 

17. Run `sudo npm install` in **Terminal** to add new dependencies you listed in `package.json` to the **node_modules** folder.

### E. Build shiny.exe

> [!NOTE]
> You need to run step after this, **whenever** you want to update shiny application.

18. Test your shiny application work by `electron-forge start` in **Terminal**.

19. If error occurs while `electron-forge make` with `conf.d` Delete `r-mac/fontconfig/fonts/conf.d`. see this [issue](https://github.com/zarathucorp/shiny-electron-template-m1/issues/5)

20. If the app runs successfully, congratulations! Create the `.exe`(as ZIP) on the `electron-forge make` in **Terminal**. Your app can be found in the **/out** folder. (Strongly recommend to **change read-only property** with mac's `Finder`)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Additionals

- Raise an issue, please.

### Error with require() of ES Module

It doesn't affect to run shiny.

### Add not-CRAN packages

- manually copy library from your **Local's R library** to **r-mac/library**, You can check Local's R library with `.libPaths()` in **R console**.

### Infinite loading in Electron-forge start / make

- First, change app.R code as basic [example](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/blob/main/inst/examples/01_hello/app.R).
- If this works well, your app.R code has problem. In my case, I updated R package in shiny application but not in library of R-win directory. 
- So update them with recent version, and try again will work.
